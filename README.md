List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to building software. It typically involves several phases, each with specific goals and deliverables. Here are some common phases:

Planning:

This phase involves defining the project's scope, objectives, and requirements.
Key activities include feasibility studies, market analysis, and creating a project plan.
Requirements Analysis:

This phase involves gathering detailed information about the software's functionality, features, and constraints.
Requirements are documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
Design:

The design phase focuses on creating a blueprint for the software's architecture, components, and interfaces.
It involves creating high-level and low-level design documents.
Development:

This phase involves writing the actual code for the software based on the design specifications.
Developers use programming languages, frameworks, and tools to implement the required features.
Testing:

The testing phase involves identifying and fixing defects in the software.
Various testing techniques, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, are used to ensure quality. Â  
Deployment:

This phase involves deploying the software to the production environment where it will be used.
It may include installation, configuration, and data migration.
Maintenance:

After deployment, the software requires ongoing maintenance to address issues, add new features, and improve performance.
This phase includes activities like bug fixes, updates, and technical support.

It's important to note that the specific phases and their order can vary depending on the project's size, complexity, and methodology (e.g., Agile, Waterfall).
